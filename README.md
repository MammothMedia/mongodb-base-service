# MongoDB base service

This provides a simple wrapper of MongoDB to assist with creating/updating/etc.. especially when some things are embedded documents. Docs are still TBD but look at [graphql-mongodb-boilerplate](https://github.com/briandeboer/graphql-mongodb-boilerplate) for an example of how to use.
